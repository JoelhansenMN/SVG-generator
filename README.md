# Objec Oriented Programming - SVG Logo Maker

## Description
  For this task we were instructed to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape (circle, square, or Triangel), provide text for the logo (up to three characters only), and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.  This application uses inquirer and Jest.  In addition to the functionality of the application, this application's shape functions were tested by jest to make sure that they were rendering correctly.  The application is invoked from the command line with node index.js
